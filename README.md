Got it 😅 — here’s your entire **README.md** in one single code cell, no breaks, ready to paste straight into GitHub:

# 🧑‍🦳 Elderly Fall Detection using OpenCV + Mediapipe  
This project is a **real-time fall detection system** built with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [Mediapipe](https://mediapipe.dev/). It tracks human body posture through the webcam, analyzes hip and shoulder positions, and raises an alert when a fall is detected.  
## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Real-time fall detection via webcam  
- ✅ Pose estimation with Mediapipe  
- ✅ Lightweight – runs locally on CPU  
- ✅ Visual feedback with skeletal landmarks  
- ✅ Red **“Fall Detected!”** alert overlay  
## 📸 Demo  
When a fall is detected, you’ll see this on the webcam feed:

## 🛠 Installation  
Clone the repo and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/elderly-fall-detection.git
cd elderly-fall-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

**requirements.txt**

```
opencv-python
mediapipe
numpy
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python fall_detection.py
```

* Press **Q** to quit the webcam window
* To test, crouch down or lower your body until hips drop near the bottom of the frame (⚠️ don’t actually fall 😅)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Mediapipe Pose tracks key body landmarks (hips, shoulders, nose).
2. Calculates average y-coordinates of shoulders and hips.
3. If hips move close to the bottom of the frame (`> 0.8` normalized value), a fall is flagged.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

* 🔔 Sound alerts and SMS notifications
* 📊 Logging detected falls for long-term monitoring
* 📱 Mobile version with TensorFlow Lite
* 🤖 Smarter ML-based classification instead of fixed threshold

Want me to add **badges (Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe)** at the very top so it looks extra slick on GitHub?
